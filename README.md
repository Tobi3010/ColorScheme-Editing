# ColorScheme-Editing

This is a work in progress project. The goal is to make a program that can read the color scheme of a image, 
in different formats, and allow the user to edit the color scheme by rotation it around the colorwheel, and maybe
even allow to go from one color scheme to another, from monocromatic to analogous, from complimentary to 
split-complimentaary, etc.
